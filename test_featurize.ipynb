    "Using the dictionary approach I am now able to get some cohesive energies. I am still getting many NAN's so I would like to include a weighted energy for the constitiuent atoms. One idea for how to do this, is to try and pass multiple columns to `featurize_many`. To do this I will need to add an `element` column to the data. May consider using PMG's `reduced_formula` in place of a dictionary."
